# JSON to Database
The process of converting JSON to a database is implemented in the following files:
- `svf/lib/SVFIR/Neo4jClient.cpp`
- `svf/lib/SVFIR/Neo4jClient.py`
- `svf/lib/SVFIR/SVFFileSystem.cpp`

## Neo4j C++ Demo
The `neo4j-cpp-demo` folder includes minimal examples demonstrating how to run Neo4j in Python and call the functions in Python using C++. Note that `demo.cpp` is not complete, it was aimed to build a minimal example from SVF.

## Testing and Debugging

### Database Writing
Since the database writing process is implemented in `SVFFileSystem.cpp`, use `dump-json` to test the written code.

### Debugging
To debug whether the data has been written into the database, use the commands provided in `svf-usage-demo`.
